# logbuch-freiheit

This collection of scripts creates an audio podcast web site + feed from a YouTube playlist.
I built this as a quick hack for [logbuch-freiheit.de](https://logbuch-freiheit.de).
It heavily relies on [octopod](https://github.com/jekyll-octopod/jekyll-octopod) as well es [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) for scraping and format conversion.

This can probably be used to import just about any YouTube-Channel after you make a couple of edits to the settings.
